## for planets to have physics appropriate for size

### cores
### crusts
### plates
### oceans
### atomspheres
### gaseous chemistry
    ### covelent bonds, vast storms
    ### physics of gigantic lightning strikes
### storm chemistry
### crater physics
### approximation of G and g in planetoid destruction events
### physics and effective pathing between zones
    ### fast optimal octtree balancing and G / g approximation
    ### including recorded event playback like they used in Uncharted (tm) games.
### stresses and factors for super giant shapes
### shapes and structures built through quantum tunnelling and massive quantum entangled atom structures
    ### breeding algorithms with specific annealling goals or limits to build toward specific shapes and parameters
    (e.x. a spaceship turning half of a planet into a dyson reflector, entangled to the planet so the shell of a planet sits in orbit while much of the planet's mass sit directly on the sun - what would the space faring people have to do to keep the planet from crumbling? If not inhabited, maybe they just let it go, and since they're moving much of the mass into the center of the solar system, how would this effect planet elliptoids)
    ### plasma flumes, and other phenomina as an active consideration for human or intelligent species built constructions - a city suspended on plasma reintegrated to a star would have different considerations than a city on floating pontoons, or rooted in traditional construction, or on the side of a mountain.
